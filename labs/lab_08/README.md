#Lab 08 - Major Skill Review
We will explore what we know and what we still need to work on by doing a modeling challenge. The data is [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
##Challenge
Prepare an MVP (Minimum Viable Product, basically a model that isn't completely unreasonable) that predicts whether the person has greater than 50K household income.<br>
Work with the others at your table to complete this task, some skills you will need are:
* Load and read data
* Visualization
* Impute missing values
* Scale values
* Binarize, label encode, make dummies
* Process -> Fit pipeline
* Parameter tuning (grid search)
* Validate, measure performance (metrics)

We will be available for consultation and troubleshooting.<br>
